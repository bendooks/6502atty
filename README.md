# 6502 Atty

A 6502 SBC with an ATMega as a contoller and monitor for the 6502.

This is an initial commit as PCBs are off for manufacture and not been tested. This includes the prototype firmware and the first cut of the firmware code.


# Firmware

The firmware is currently in development. To build, you will need at-least avr-gcc and the relevant libraries and is currently only being tested on Linux (Debian). Once built, download to the ATMega using something like avrdude.

## Revision information

The original prototype version was built on a perfboard, and not release.
